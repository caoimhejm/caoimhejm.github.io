    <h1 class="MooresLw_Heading">Moore's Law</h1> 
    <h2>What is Moore's Law?</h2>
    <p>Moore's Law, named after Intel's co-founder Gordon Moore (in 1965), states that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles every two years. This means our computers get faster and more powerful every two years, but they also become cheaper.
    In the decades that followed Gordon Moore's original observation, Moore's Law guided the semiconductor industry (companies engaged in the design and fabrication of semiconductors and semiconductor devices, such as transistors and integrated circuits) in long-term planning and setting targets for research and development.</p>

    <h3>Gordon Moore</h3>
    <p>Gordon Moore co-founded Intel with Robert Noyce in 1968. He had a strong background in chemistry and physics, earning his Ph.D. from Caltech after working at Shell Oil and Fairchild Semiconductor. At Intel, Moore served as CEO and played a pivotal role in making the company a leader in microprocessors. He received several prestigious awards for his contributions.</p>

<h2>Years Later</h2>
  <p>Years later, we can still feel the lasting impact and benefits of Moore's Law in many ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <h4><b>Computing</b></h4>
      <li>As transistors in computer chips get better, computers get smaller and faster. These chips have tiny structures made of carbon and silicon, perfectly arranged to make electricity flow faster. When chips process electricity faster, computers work better. The price of powerful computers is going down each year, partly because labor costs are lower, and the cost of making chips is also less.</li>
<h4><b>Electronics</b></h4>
      <li>Moore's Law is super useful in our high-tech world. It helps make things like smartphones, tablets, video games, spreadsheets, weather forecasts, and GPS work.</li>
      <h4><b>All Sectors benefit</b></h4>
      <li>Smaller and faster computers are making transportation, healthcare, education, and energy production better. These are just a few examples of the industries that have improved thanks to more powerful computer chips.</li>
    </ul>
